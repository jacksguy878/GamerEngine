# Friday Night Funkin' - Gamer Engine
It is basically modified Psych engine with extra keys (https://github.com/tposejank/FNF-PsychEngine-ExtraKeys), it does cool stuff, download lastest action build for lastest update

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

## Credits:
* Just download the thing and all credits are inside lol.
